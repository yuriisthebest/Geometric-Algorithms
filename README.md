# Ruler of the Plane

Ruler of the Plane is a set of games illustrating concepts from combinatorial and computational geometry. The games are based on the art gallery problem, ham-sandwich cuts, the Voronoi game, and geometric network connectivity problems like the Euclidean minimum spanning tree and traveling salesperson problem. 

The games are implemented using C# in the game engine Unity.

There is a website for the games, where also the online WebGL version is hosted:
